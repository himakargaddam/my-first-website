			<p>Hi, welcome to my website. I graduated from New Mexico State University with majors in EE. I surf the web a lot and when I used to come across amazing websites it always intruiged my curiosity. I wanted to know how it was possible to create something that amazing by just coding. This was the starting point for my career in Interactive web development. Developing web pages is very challenging but also that much fun.</p>
