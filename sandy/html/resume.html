Jawaharlal  Nehru Technological University, <br/>
Hyderabad              <br/>                                                                       
Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering
<h2>TECHNICAL SKILLS:</h2>
Programming Languages: C, C++ <br/>
Tools and Technologies: MATLAB, ADC <br/>
Operating Systems: MS Windows XP/7/8/10, Linux.<br/>

<h2>ACADEMIC PROJECTS:</h2>
<h3>SOLAR POWER GENERATION USING A SEVEN LEVEL INVERTER:</h3>
In this project I designed a graphical version of the ac power generation using the solar panels i.e.., the dc power generated by the solar panels is very less in range (voltage) hence a dc to dc converter is used to enhance the voltage range and we can even regulate it and then a seven level inverter is used to generate a desired ac output voltage which can also be controlled, the project has been demonstrated using MATLAB software. 
<h2>UNDER GRADUATION PROJECTS:</h2>
<h3>AUTOMATIC STREET LIGHT CONTROLLING USING LDR BASED TECHNOLOGY:</h3>
This project demonstrates the way of switching on/off of the street light which is possible by using LDR, IR technology. This project works on the basis of light intensity.  

<h2>ENHANCEMENT OF POWER QUALITY IN DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USING D-STATCOM</h2>
This project deals with enhancement of power quality (voltage sags). In this project the voltage sags during the fault condition can be eliminated by using a device D-STATCOM


<h2>STRENGHTS</h2>
Good organizing skills to meet the deadlines	
Strong willingness to learn more technical skills.


<h2>EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES:</h2>
Worked as organizer for the event “PAPER PRESENTATION” for NIETROLIGHTZ-2K11</br>
Won the cricket tournaments at the school and college levels.</br>
